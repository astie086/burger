*Eat-Da-Fries! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of fries they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a type of fries's name, your app will display the fries to be devoured -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each order of fries in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
